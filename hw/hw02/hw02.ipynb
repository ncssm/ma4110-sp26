    "Oops, we made a typo! Instead of dividing by 12, we wanted to **multiply** each number by 12. Compute the correct products in the cell below using array arithmetic and store them in an array called `products`. The purpose of this question is to help you realize that it's much easier to perform (and in this case, change) arithmetic on an array all at once, rather than having to do so once for each element in the array. Notice that your job is going to be really easy if you previously defined an array containing the 4 numbers."

    "You determined in an earlier question that the average subscriber count during this time period was around 75 million. Therefore, you might *expect* the **total cumulative** subscriber-years to be `75 * n` million after `n` years during this 15 year period.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `np.arange` function to create an array of values where each element represents the **total cumulative** subscriber-years (in millions) one would expect Netflix to have accumulated by the end of each year, for 15 years. Use the assumption that they have 75 million subscribers each year. For example, the first element would be 75, the second element 150, the third 225, and so on. Assign this array of values to `expected_subscribers`. You can read about `np.arange` as needed in this [textbook section](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/05/2/Ranges.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, determine how the actual total cumulative subscriber-years over the 15 year period compared to what we expected to happen under our assumption. Set `difference_from_expected` to an array of 15 elements, where each element is the **absolute difference** between the actual cumulative subscribers and expected cumulative subscribers in that particular year.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, since the first three subscriber counts are 20.01, 23.53, and 27.15 million. The total cumulative for 3 years is 20.01 + 23.53 + 27.15 = 70.69. The expected for 3 years is 75 * 3 = 225. Therefore, `difference_from_expected.item(2)` should be $|70.69 - 225| = 154.31$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1**: You'll need to use the `np.cumsum` function to create the array of actual cumulative subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2**: When using the absolute value function, use `np.abs` instead of `abs`, since `numpy` is already loaded in this notebook, and that's what the autograder is going to use."

    "Let's imagine your guess for the next year's subscriber count was always just the subscriber count of the previous year. If you always guessed the previous year's count, how big would your error in guessing be, on average? Compute the value using some `numpy` operations and assign your answer to `average_error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the first three subscriber counts are 20.01, 23.53, and 27.15. After the first year you guess the next year's count will be 20.01 million, but it is 23.53 million resulting in an error of $|20.01 - 23.53|$. For the next year you now guess there will be 23.53 million subscribers, but there are 27.15 million, so the error is $|23.53 - 27.15|$. Therefore, the average error for just the second and third years would be $$\\frac{|20.01-23.53| + |23.53-27.15|}{2} = 3.52$$."
